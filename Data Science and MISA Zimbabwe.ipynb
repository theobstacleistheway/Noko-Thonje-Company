    "The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook presentation is to introduce MISA Zimbabwe to data science. Data science is the study of the\n",
    "extraction of knowledge from data. It uses various techniques from many fields, including signal processing, mathematics,\n",
    "probability models, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern matching, data visualization, \n",
    "uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting useful knowledge from the data.\n",
    "Data Science is not restricted to only big data, although the fact that data is scaling up makes big data an important aspect of \n",
    "data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists solve complicated data problems using mathematics, statistics and computer science, although very good skill in \n",
    "these subjects are not required.[1] However, a data scientist is most likely to be an expert in only one or two of these \n",
    "disciplines, meaning that cross disciplinary teams can be a key component of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good data scientists are able to apply their skills to achieve a broad spectrum of end results. The skill-sets and competencies \n",
    "that data scientists employ vary widely.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that by using data science, MISA Zimbabwe can learn more about how ZImbabweans are utilising what \n",
    "freedom of expression they have, and learn about the various issues that Zimbabweans who use social media, are discussing. In order\n",
    "to achieve this aim, we will go through a standard and basic workflow to demonstrate ways in which data science can be used. The \n",
    "subject of this workflow will be the recently passed general elections. \n",

    "majority do not — everything posted is public information, just as if you printed it up on a flyer or yelled it loudly in the\n",

    "Using [Twitter’s own systems or third-party apps](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-09-14-twitter-data) that scrape data from the site, scientists can get [free samples of tweets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5639727/) — [drawn\n",

    "of tweets. And, since Twitter is predominantly a text-based medium, it’s easier to analyze and compare those messages with one \n",
    "another than it would be to study Instagram, which has a similar level of public availability, Cesare said. Earlier this week, \n",
    "[Twitter announced that it would begin to put some limits](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2018/new-developer-requirements-to-protect-our-platform.html) on how many of these requests people can make and which apps they can \n",
